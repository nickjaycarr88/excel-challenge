# Microsoft Excel Crowdfunding challenge

###
Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo have been growing in success and popularity since the late 2000s. From independent content creators to famous celebrities, more and more people are using crowdfunding to launch new products and generate buzz, but not every project has found success.

To receive funding, the project must meet or exceed an initial goal, so many organisations dedicate considerable resources looking through old projects in an attempt to discover “the trick” to finding success.

The purpose of this project is to organise and analyse a dataset of 1000 samples to uncover any hidden trends.

## Color code the outcome column depending on if the project was successful, failed or cancelled. Then color code the percent funded to find out how much moeny a campaign made relative to its initial funding goal.

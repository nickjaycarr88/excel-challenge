# Microsoft Excel Crowdfunding challenge

###
Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo have been growing in success and popularity since the late 2000s. From independent content creators to famous celebrities, more and more people are using crowdfunding to launch new products and generate buzz, but not every project has found success.

To receive funding, the project must meet or exceed an initial goal, so many organisations dedicate considerable resources looking through old projects in an attempt to discover “the trick” to finding success.

The purpose of this project is to organise and analyse a dataset of 1000 samples to uncover any hidden trends.

## Conditional Formatting
### Color code the outcome column depending on if the project was successful, failed or cancelled. Then color code the percent funded to find out how much moeny a campaign made relative to its initial funding goal.

## Findings
### **Given the provided data, what are the three conclusions that we can draw about the crowdfunding campaigns?**
From the provided data, we can conclude that a campaign has a 57% chance of being successful, a 37% chance of failing and about a 6% chance of being cancelled.

### **What are some of the limitations of this dataset?**
This dataset does not consider the background/ experience of the people raising money. I feel there would be a strong connection with successful campaigns and people who have a rich experience in an industry as well as entrepreneurial experience who is seeking to create something new for that industry, as opposed to someone who is new and never ran a business before. 

### **What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional values would they provide?**
We could add a table to show the countries where campaigns are the most successful, which would let us know which country to crowdfund in.
We could add a table that shows the best amount of time to keep a campaign live in oder to have the highest percentage of reaching your goal.
We could have a table which shows which industries have the most successful campaigns. This will let us know which industries are the most successful.
We could have a chart which shows the specific months of the year which campaigns are launched. This may help us identify a certain time of year to launch or not launch a campaign.
